# StockRevenueData

In this project for my Python Project for Data Science course, I extracted some stock data and displayed the data in a graph, namely those of Tesla and GameStop. This involved some web-scraping.

Here I showcase my elementary use cases of python libraries such as yfinance, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, and plotly.
